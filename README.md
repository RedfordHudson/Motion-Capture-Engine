# Motion Signal Feedback Engine

## Description

**Motion Capture Engine** is a real-time motion capture system designed to convert motion inputs into event triggers. Built with low-latency, modular components, it is engineered for use in tactical and defense applications, providing a motion-based control interface for embedded system control.

## Context

A new battlefield is emerging, defined by increased computing, distributed operations, and autonomous sensors. This new ecosystem is called the Military Internet of Things (MIoT), and it demands responsive, decentralized, and adaptive technologies for real-time decision-making at the tactical edge.

## Key Features

- **Motion-Based Sensors** → intuitive control; Wearable and haptic sensors give operators intuitive control over cybernetic IoT systems by using natural gestures as inputs.
- **Modular Architecture** → adaptive integration; Modular system design allows seamless integration of diverse input sensors and output devices, enabling rapid prototyping and mission-specific customization across a range of tactical applications.
- **Low-Latency Toolchain** → faster feedback; Low-latency tech stack enables real-time data flow and processing, minimizes delay and enhances operator performance in real-time, high-intensity environments.
